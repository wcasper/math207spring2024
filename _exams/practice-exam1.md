### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  
In the actual exam, you will be allowed scratch paper and a pencil, but no calculator or note sheet.


**Problem 1:** 

Classify each of the following differential equations by their type.
You do NOT need to solve it (except it would be good practice!)

* (a) $$y' = \frac{x+y}{x-y}$$
* (b) $$y' + e^{2x}y = 3x^2$$
* (c) $$\frac{1}{xy}y' = y^2\cos(x)$$
* (d) $$3x + ye^{xy} + (2y + xe^{xy})y' = 0$$
* (e) $$y' + 3x^2y = y^5$$

**Problem 2:** 

Solve the differential equation

$$3y^2 + 5x^2y + (3xy + 2x^3)y' = 0.$$

[Hint: find an integrating factor of the form $$x^ay^b$$.

**Problem 3:**

Find a general solution of each of the following differential equations.
If the equation has an initial value, instead solve the initial value problem.

* (a) $$y^2 + \cos(x) + (2xy + \sin(y))y' = 0$$
* (b) $$3x^2\ln(x) + x^2-y -xy' = 0,\ \ y(1) = 5$$
* (c) $$xy' = x\tan(y/x) + y$$
* (d) $$xy-1 + x^2y' = 0$$

**Problem 4:**

Find solve the following first order linear differential equation using both the method of integrating factors as well as the method of variation of parameters:

$$y' + 2y = \cos(3x).$$

**Problem 5:**

Consider the differential equation

$$y' = x^2 + y^2.$$

* (a) Sketch a picture of the slope field for $$-1\leq x\leq 1$$ and $$-1\leq y\leq 1$$.
* (b) Inside the slope field, sketch the integral curve passing through $$(0,0)$$.

**Problem 6:**

Consider the initial value problem

$$y' = x^2 + y^2,\ \ y(0) = 0.$$

Use Forward Euler with a time step of $$h = 0.25$$ to approximate the values of $$y(0.25)$$, $$y(0.5)$$, $$y(0.75)$$ and $$y(1.0)$$.

**Problem 7:**

Give an example or explain why no example exists.

* (a) A differential equation $$M(x,y) + N(x,y)y' = 0$$ which is closed but not exact
* (b) An initial value problem with more than one solution
* (c) A solution of $$y' = y(y-1)(y+2)$$ which takes both positive and negative values
* (d) An autonomous differential equation with a semistable equilibrium value at $$y=3$$
* (e) A differential equation which is invariant under the transformation $$u=x$$ and $$v = 3y$$
