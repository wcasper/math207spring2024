**Question 1:**

True or false.
The function $$y=x^2$$ is a solution of the differential equation

$$2y'' = \frac{(y')^2}$$

**Question 2:**

True or false.
Studying differential equations is really just learning a bag of tricks.

**Question 3:**

Multiple choice.
A curve in a slope field whose tangent lines are always parallel to the slope field is called an
* (A) isopycnal
* (B) integral curve
* (C) contour line
* (D) characteristic curve

**Question 4:**

True or false.
If $$f(x,y)$$ and $$f_x(x,y)$$ are both continuous in a rectangle containing the point $$(0,0)$$, then the initial value problem

$$y' = f(x,y),\ \ y(0) = 0$$

has a unique solution.
