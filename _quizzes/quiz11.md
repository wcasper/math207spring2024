**Question 1:**  True or false.

The set of all rational numbers is a real vector space.

**Question 2:**  True or false.

The set

$$\{A: \text{$A$ is a real $2\times 2$ matrix and $A^T=A$}\}$$

is a vector space.

**Question 3:**  True or false.

The set of all real valued functions $$f(x)$$ on $$[0,1]$$ satisfying $$f(0) = f(1)$$ is a real vector space.

**Question 4:**  True or false.

The set of all real valued functions $$f(x)$$ on $$[0,1]$$ satisfying $$f(0)^2 = f(1)^2$$ is a real vector space.

**Question 5:**  Multiple choice.

Which of the following is an example of a subspace of $$\mathbb{R}^3$$

* (A) The subset $$\{(x,y,z): x + 2y + 3z = 1\}$$
* (B) The subset $$\{(x,y,z): x^2=y^2+z^2\}$$
* (C) The subset $$\{(x,y,z): x+y=2z\}$$
* (D) The subset $$\{(x,y,z): x\ \text{is an integer}\}$$
