**Question 1:**  True or false.

The set

$$\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2: y =x^2\}$$

is a subspace of $$\mathbb{R}^2$$.

**Question 2:**  True or false.

If $$W$$ is a subspace of $$\mathbb{R}^3$$, then $$W$$ is either the trivial subspace, a line through the origin, a plane through the origin, or all of $$\mathbb R^3$$.

**Question 3:**  Multiple choice.

The set

$$\left\lbrace\binom{x}{y}: \lvert x \rvert = \lvert y\rvert\right\rbrace$$

is not a subspace of the space of all $$2\times 1$$ column vectors, because it doesn't satisfy which of the following conditions

* (A) it does not contain the zero vector
* (B) it is not closed under scalar multiplication
* (C) it is not closed under vector addition
* (D) both (B) and (C).

**Question 4:**  True or false.

The vector $$\left(\begin{array}{c}-3\\ 2\\ 1\end{array}\right)$$ is in the span of the set of vectors

$$\left\lbrace
\left(\begin{array}{c}1\\ -2\\ 1\end{array}\right),
\left(\begin{array}{c}5\\ -2\\ -3\end{array}\right)
\right\rbrace$$

**Question 5:**  True or false.

The vector $$\left(\begin{array}{c}1\\ 2\\ 1\end{array}\right)$$ is in the span of the set of vectors

$$\left\lbrace
\left(\begin{array}{c}1\\ -2\\ 1\end{array}\right),
\left(\begin{array}{c}5\\ -2\\ -3\end{array}\right)
\right\rbrace$$
