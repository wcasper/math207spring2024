**Question 1:**  True or false.

The set of all vectors in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$ is a basis for $$\mathbb{R}^3$$

**Question 2:**  True or false.

If $$V$$ is an $$3$$-dimensional vector space, then any spanning set must have at least three vectors.

**Question 3:**  True or false.

If $$V$$ is an $$3$$-dimensional vector space, then any linearly independent set has at most three vectors.

**Question 4:**  True or false.

The set $$\{1,2x-3,x^2-4x+5\}$$ is a basis for

$$V = \{p(x): p(x)\ \text{is a degree two polynomial}\}.$$

**Question 5:**  True or false.

If $$B$$ is a set of $$n$$ linearly independent vectors in a vector space, then $$B$$ is a basis.

**Question 6:**  True or false.

If $$B$$ is a set of $$n$$ linearly independent vectors in an $$n$$-dimensional vector space, then $$B$$ is a basis.
