**Question 1:** True or false.

The following differential equation is separable

$$y' = x + y$$

**Question 2:**  True or false.

For any constant $$C$$,

$$\left\lbrace\begin{array}{cc}
u &= x\\
v &= (y^3+C)^{1/3}\\
\end{array}\right.

is a symmetry of the differential equation

$$3y^2y' = \cos(x).$$

**Question 3:**  Numerical.

Suppose that $$y$$ satisfies the initial value problem

$$y' = 2xy^2,\ \ y(0) = 1.$$

Determine the value of $$y(2)$$.

:caution: Enter your answer as a decimal!

**Question 4:**  Numerical.

How many equilibrium points does the following autonomous equation have?

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = y^2(1-y^2)$$
