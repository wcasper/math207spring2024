**Question 1:**  Multiple choice.

Consider the following autonomous differential equation

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = y^2(1-y^2).$$

If $$y(0) = 2$$, what value will $$y$$ approach as $$x$$ goes to infinity?
* (A) $$\infty$$
* (B) $$0$$
* (C) $$1$$
* (D) $$-\infty$$

**Question 2:**  Multiple choice.

Consider the differential equation from Question 1.
If $$y(0) = 1/2$$, what value will $$y$$ approach as $$x$$ goes to infinity?
* (A) $$\infty$$
* (B) $$0$$
* (C) $$1$$
* (D) $$-\infty$$

**Question 3:**  Multiple choice.

Consider the differential equation 

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = y(1-y^2).$$

Which of the following is a type of equilibrium value that we talked about but which is *not* featured by this equation.
* (A) stable
* (B) bifurcation
* (C) semistable
* (D) unstable

**Question 4:** True or false.

A first-order **homogeneous equation** is an equation of the form

$$y' = f(x)/f(y).$$

**Question 5:** True or false.

The correct substitution to solve a first-order homogeneous equation is $$z = y/x$$.
