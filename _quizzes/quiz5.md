**Question 1:**  True or false.

The equation

$$y - xy' = 0$$

is exact.

**Question 2:**  True or false.

The function $$\mu = e^x$$ is an integrating factor for the equation

$$y+xy + xy' = 0.$$

* Hint: you don't need to find an integrating factor.  Just multiply by the suggested $$\mu$$ and see if the result is exact!

**Question 3:** Multiple choice.

Suppose we proposed an integrating factor of the form $$\mu = \mu(x)$$ (ie. a function of $$x$$ only) and ended up with the equation

$$\mu'(x) = 2x\mu(x).$$

Which of the following is true.

* (A) An integrating factor does not exist.
* (B) An integrating factor is $$\mu = 2x$$.
* (C) An integrating factor does exist, but it is not a function of $$x$$ only.  We need to make a different assumption.
* (D) An integrating factor is $$\mu = e^{x^2}$$.


**Question 4:** Multiple choice.

Suppose we proposed an integrating factor of the form $$\mu = \mu(x)$$ (ie. a function of $$x$$ only) and ended up with the equation

$$\mu'(x) = (2x + 2y)\mu(x).$$

Which of the following is true.

* (A) An integrating factor does not exist.
* (B) An integrating factor is $$y=x$$.
* (C) An integrating factor does exist, but it is not a function of $$x$$ only.  We need to make a different assumption.
* (D) An integrating factor is $$\mu = e^{x^2+y^2}$$.
