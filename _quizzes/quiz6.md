**Question 1:**  True or false.

During his dive, Felix Bamgartner broke the sound barrier.

**Question 2:**  True or false.

At around $$35$$ seconds (give or take) Felix started experiencing an uncontrollable spin and had to reposition his body to eventually regain control.

**Question 3:**  True or false.

The most important thing to take into account in a body falling from the stratosphere is changes in the gravitational acceleration experienced.

**Question 4:**  Numerical.

If you drop a bowling ball in the ocean, its speed $$s$$ (in units of m/s) as a function of time $$t$$ (in units of s) satisfies the differential equation

$$s' = 9.81 - 5.8s^2.$$

After it has fallen long enough, it will reach a maximum possible velocity, called the **terminal velocity**.
Use the equilibria of the above differential equation to determine the terminal velocity, up to two decimal places.
