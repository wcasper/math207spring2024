**Question 1:**  True or false.

The function $$\mu(x,y) = xy$$ is an integrating factor for the equation

$$2y^2 + 2y + (3xy + 2x)y' = 0.$$

**Question 2:**  True or false.

The following is a homogenous first-order linear equation

$$y' + 3y = x.$$

**Question 3:**  True or false.

In the method of **variation of parameters**, we propose a solution of the form $$y = v(x)y_h$$, where $$y_h$$ is a solution of the associated homogeneous equation.

**Question 4:**  Numerical.

For which value of $$a$$ is $$\mu = e^{ax}$$ an integrating factor for

$$y' - 2y = \tan(x).$$
