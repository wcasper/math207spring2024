**Question 1:**  Multiple choice.  Which of the following is NOT a numerical method for ODEs that we discussed in class.

* (A) forward Euler
* (B) backward Euler
* (C) leapfrog
* (D) Runge-Kutta

**Question 2:**  True or false.

A differential equation is called **stiff** if it requires a very small step size $$h$$ to achieve accuracy, relative to the desired time scales.


**Question 3:**  True or false.

We should always use backward Euler instead of forward Euler.

**Question 4:**  Numerical.

Using a time step of $$h = 0.1$$, use forward Euler to approximate $$y(0.3)$$ where $$y$$ is the solution of the initial value problem

$$y' = sin(ty),\ \ \ y(0) = 1$$

Enter your answer accurate to three decimal places.
